                <h6 style="color: #e396d1">I am Catherine Joy Liao Chan. A 20 year old college student from FEU Institute of Technology studying Information Technology specializing in Web and Mobile Applications. I'm just simple Filipino-Chinese girl that has a lot of goals in
                    life. Aside from aiming to be a billionaire, one of my important goals is to make my parents really proud of me and to return the favor. In the family, I am the only one who took a different course that is not a business course. Inoformation
                    Technology mey be my course but it's not my first choice. I had another choice in mind but I think I chose the right course. Studying technology can make your brain hang for a while like them. But the good thing is, it can make your
                    logical and critical thinking skills healthy. Also, it can make you improve at multitasking. In this course, I have learned to be independent and have a long patience when coding. Itâ€™s not easy to write a code but practice makes perfect.

                <h6 style="color: #e396d1"> I am John Lerick Estacio, 20 years old who lives in Pasig City. I am currently studying in Far Eastern University Institute of Technology with the chosen program Information Technology. Actually, I'm not as smart as what you think, hence,
                    I'm just an average student who balances all of the events in my life and maybe is one of my advantages to others. I am a member of Parish Youth Ministry who leads and help other youth to deepen their faith. I am also a good friend
                    whom you can lean on when needed. As you've noticed, I have a lot of things that I do, and this is what I love. I want everyday to be productive because as long as I love what I am doing, I will never be tired of doing it. When it
                    comes to academics, I can say that I am not that improving when it comes to my course, especially in programming and other skills that are needed. As I dont love what course I chose but I am now learning to love it. I wish that I am
                    just a late bloomer and I hope it will happen someday. For now, I am doing what I need to do, to study. In the near future, I wish that I will achieve all of my dreams, as a successful IT Analyst, having a great family and a shelter
                    that we can bond. I want my children to experience a life that they deserve. For now, that is all. Maybe tomorrow, there will be a additional dream that I need as I believe that dont ever be tired of dreaming for yourself as you need
                    it to be inspired everyday.

                    trials that adulthood may give me. I know it is not always rainbows and sunshines because I have had my fair share of thunderstorms and disasters. Now, that I am on my way into being a full grown butterfly, I cannot wait for what life
                    has yet to offer me. It was once said that 'We are all butterflies and Earth is our chrysalis.' which makes me ponder about how thriving my metamorphosis may be.I am Camille Mendoza, 21 years old and currently studying at FEU TECH
